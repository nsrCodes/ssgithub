# ssgithub
A backend project to get hands dirty with async rust programming inspired from downgit

The next time you need to download a subdirectory of any github repository, navigate to that directory on your browser, and change the domain of the url from `github.com` to `ssgithub.com` (_Just add `ss` to the start_)

This should download the contents of that particular directory as a `tar.gzip`

```
On windows you might have to change the file extnesion to `.tar.gzip`.
Only then will file be detected by extractors like winrar
```

Feel free to raise an issue, or reach out to me on twitter if you face any issues
